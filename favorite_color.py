# I believe this short, scripted conversation earned a "5" on the grading ruberic, as it met several creativity requirements,
# such as changing the default answer, adding the additional answer with the original answer in the computers output, 
# As well as asking an additional question.
# I also tried giving the responses their own personality, hopefully I didn't overdo it.
